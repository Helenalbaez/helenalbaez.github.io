## Helena Baezâ€™s Portfolio

Hello! I am a Computer Engineering Major here at CSUF planning on graduating in 2028.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 3 

	I enjoyed learning how to use cin and cout in functions as I could input any height, weight, age and identity and could see the output change accordingly. We learned to implement a specific equation into a function.
Lab 4 

	This lab was interesting because we created a function with multiple steps but that all connected to one input. Learning to use connecting symbols and functions helped to put the lab together. I enjoyed working with something familiar like cups, ounces and milliliters.
Lab 5 

	In this lab we used two files to compile a code after inputting our length and width, learning to put together more code than we had before. This was interesting to look back and forth at each file and connect the necessary code.
